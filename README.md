Introduction

In the era of advanced technology, information updates every second on the internet,
and social networks are evolving continuously and constantly. The classical
paradigm that reads static datasets is inadequate for the current social network and
web graph setting. The accuracy is decreasing due to the high information
transmission rate nowadays.
To address the PageRank accuracy declining problem, the research paper
“PageRank on an Evolving Graph” by Bahmani, Bahman, et al. proposed it is
necessary to design an algorithm that crawls the pages with its decision and
computes the PageRank using the obtained information with a lower error. The
public is pursuing the internet to understand their needs and be more convenient for
receiving information, entertaining, and communicating. Improving the evolving
graph is always needed due to social networks and web graphs changing
continuously.
